================================================

**Bridge:** From Individual Components to Intelligent Behavior

Learning Objectives
-------------------

- Implement behavioral planning strategies  
- Handle multi-agent interactions  
- Ensure safety in critical scenarios  

Outline
-------

Part 1: Decision Making Under Uncertainty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduces probabilistic and logic-based decision frameworks including Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs), and Bayesian networks.

Part 2: Behavioral Planning Architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discusses rule-based, state-machine, and hierarchical behavior planners. Covers decision layering and interaction between planning and prediction modules.

Part 3: Multi-Agent Reasoning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explores coordination among multiple vehicles using game theory, cooperative and non-cooperative strategies, and intent inference models.

Part 4: Safety-Critical Decision Making
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focuses on risk assessment, emergency maneuvers, and formal safety verification methods. Emphasizes compliance with safety envelopes and fail-safe transitions.

Part 5: Real-World Deployment Challenges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examines challenges in uncertain, unstructured environments such as occlusions, adversarial behaviors, and human unpredictability. Highlights robustness and scalability concerns.
